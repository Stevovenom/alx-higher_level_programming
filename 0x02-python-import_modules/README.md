In this project, I learned about importing and using functions and creating
modules in Python. I further practiced using the builtin function
dir() and using command line arguments within Python programs.

The first task which is 0-add.py](./0-add.py) is to Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.Python program that imports the function.
