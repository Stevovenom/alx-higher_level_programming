The Test-Driven Python Project is a software development project that follows the principles of test-driven development (TDD) to create Python scripts with a strong emphasis on testing. The project aims to deliver high-quality Python code by writing tests before writing the actual code, ensuring that the code meets the specified requirements and behaves as expected.

Project Summary:
The Test-Driven Python Project involves developing Python scripts and corresponding test cases following specific requirements and guidelines. The project focuses on the following key aspects:

Python Scripts:

All Python scripts should be compatible with editors like vi, vim, and emacs.
The scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
Each script should end with a new line.
The first line of each script should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
Coding Standards:

The Python code should adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines.
All files must be executable.
File Length:

The length of the files will be tested using the wc command.
Python Test Cases:

Test files should be inside a folder named tests.
All test files should have the .txt extension and be text files.
Test cases should be executed using the command python3 -m doctest ./tests/*.
Documentation:

All modules should have documentation accessible via python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'.
All functions should have documentation accessible via python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'.
Documentation should be descriptive and explain the purpose of the module, class, or method in a complete sentence.
Collaboration:

Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to cover all edge cases.
The Checker verifies the presence and correctness of tests.
By following these requirements and guidelines, the Test-Driven Python Project aims to create well-tested and maintainable Python code, ensuring reliability and ease of maintenance in the software development process.
