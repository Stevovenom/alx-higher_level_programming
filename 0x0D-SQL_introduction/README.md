## 0x0D. SQL - Introduction
The task involves the introduction to SQL.<br>
# Databases
In this section, you will learn the fundamental concepts of databases and their importance in software development which basically is used for storing data in your application. Unlike storing data in memory, databases ensure data persistence, even when the server stops. They guarantee ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

# What are Databases?
Databases are essential for storing data in your application. Unlike storing data in memory, databases ensure data persistence, even when the server stops. They guarantee ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
To work with relational databases, you need to be familiar with SQL syntax. Although it can be challenging, mastering SQL is crucial for working with databases effectively.

# Types of Databases
While relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL are popular, there are other types of databases, known as NoSQL databases. NoSQL databases offer various benefits and are essential to learn alongside relational databases.

Document-Based Databases
Document-oriented databases, such as MongoDB, offer schemaless storage and are popular for their ease of use with JSON documents. Key-value stores, like Redis, are useful for applications that require large-scale key-value storage, such as caching.

Choosing the Right Database
Each type of NoSQL database has its strengths and weaknesses. Understanding the differences between them will help you choose the right database for your project.
